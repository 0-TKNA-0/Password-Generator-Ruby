This is a password generator that uses a dictionary file which is downloaded from another Github repo which contains every english word in the dictionary. 
The user will enter the desired length of the random password as an integer. 
The program will then randomly select a word from the dictionary of the inputted length.
The program will also randomly insert special characters and numbers to make the password more complex.
Once a pasword has been generated, the user will be prompted to save the password if they like it.
The user can also regenerate a password if they do not desire to save the password that has just been created for them.
Saved passwords are saved to a json file located in the same directory as the ruby main.rb file.
